## Why Step to Jeff?

As interns, we understand the tremendous energy and nerve that is eager to immediately take hold of the opportunity given to us as curious thinkers to help build the future of Amazon and its customers. From the minute us restless interns are hired, there is an outburst of questions raised:

* How do we prepare for our internship?
* What are the expectations?
* Is there anything I can do *right now* to become the best intern there possibly is?

With over thousands of new incoming interns, many pose similar pain points when stuck in the waiting zone between their hiring date and their first day at work. While there is a network of Amazon platforms to provide resources, **there is no immediate relief for these interns to find out about their questions regarding employment and assist them in keeping track of their pre-onboarding timeline**. Interns often found themselves frustrated over lost emails, lack of direction, and confusion over whether or not an important date was coming up. We found inspiration in their struggle, and asked ourselves:

>How might we build an interactive experience that allows interns to overcome due date anxiety over the duration of their pre-onboarding, and fill the gaps of restless waiting with delightful learning experiences?

## Solution

With Step to Jeff, we aim to connect interns to that feeling of inclusivity here at Amazon and facilitate communication, rapid exchange of information, and amicable support during the intricate pre-onboarding experience phase through an interactive voice experience.

Step to Jeff is a reminder and educational Alexa Skill that aims to engage and inform interns before they have even stepped foot into Day 1. The skill is divided into tasks to fulfill, consisting of required assignments and/or Amazon culture education. These steps are based off of each internâ€™s personal timeline in their pre-onboarding process, and they are prompted to fulfill their goals as well as take initiative to immerse themselves in legal and educational resources. Through Step to Jeff, interns will be able to immediately understand their prospective goals.
